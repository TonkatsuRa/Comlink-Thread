Features I want to implement:
- DONE // Saving users in local browser storage
- DONE // Saving profile pictures in local browser storage
- DONE // Adding a delete button for Alias
- DONE // Being able to move messages up and down
- DONE // Being able to post images in the chat thread
- DONE // Being able to write "system messages" without a chat bubble like in the 80's sci-fi computer terminals
- DONE // Use of simple BBcode to post images (e.g.  [img]https://example.jpg[/img] or with width / height command like [img width="50" height="50"]https://example.jpg[/img]
- DONE // Added a simple BB-code Editor for ease of use
- DONE // Added a CRT Scanline Filter over the profile pictures just because
- Being able to export the chat thread with the full layout (kinda like a long screenshot)

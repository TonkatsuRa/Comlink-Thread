# Comlink-Thread
Small tool for my Shadowrun campaign to create handouts in the style of a comlink message

Credit for augmented-ui goes to propjockey (https://augmented-ui.com)

Features I want to implement:
- DONE // Saving users in local browser storage
- DONE //Saving profile pictures in local browser storage
- DONE // Adding a delete button for Alias
- Being able to move messages up and down
- Being able to post images in the chat thread
- Being able to write "system messages" without a chat bubble like in the 80's sci-fi computer terminals
- Being able to export the chat thread with the full layout (kinda like a long screenshot)

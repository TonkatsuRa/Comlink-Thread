- DONE //Saving profile pictures in local browser storage
- DONE // Adding a delete button for Alias
- DONE // Being able to move messages up and down
- Being able to post images in the chat thread
- DONE // Being able to write "system messages" without a chat bubble like in the 80's sci-fi computer terminals
- Being able to export the chat thread with the full layout (kinda like a long screenshot)
- DONE // Use of simple BBcode to post images (e.g.  [img]https://example.jpg[/img] or with width / height command like [img width="50" height="50"]https://example.jpg[/img]

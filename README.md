- DONE // Saving users in local browser storage
- DONE //Saving profile pictures in local browser storage
- DONE // Adding a delete button for Alias
- Being able to move messages up and down
- Being able to post images in the chat thread
- Being able to write "system messages" without a chat bubble like in the 80's sci-fi computer terminals
- Being able to export the chat thread with the full layout (kinda like a long screenshot)
